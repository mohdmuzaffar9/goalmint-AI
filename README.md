# 📖 Project Overview

GoalMint AI is an AI-powered productivity companion developed for the **Vibe2Ship Hackathon** under the problem statement **"The Last-Minute Life Saver."**

Traditional productivity applications mainly depend on reminders and notifications. While reminders inform users about upcoming deadlines, they rarely help users understand **how to complete their goals**. As a result, users often procrastinate, struggle with planning, and miss important deadlines.

GoalMint AI solves this challenge by transforming user goals into structured execution plans using **Google Gemini AI**. Instead of simply reminding users about their goals, the application automatically generates an intelligent **six-phase roadmap**, followed by **AI-generated actionable tasks** for each phase.

Users can review, edit, and personalize every AI-generated roadmap and task before saving them, ensuring that AI works as an intelligent assistant rather than replacing human decision-making.

The application also includes secure authentication, goal management, task tracking, AI insights, profile management, and optimized API usage, making it a complete productivity platform for students, professionals, and entrepreneurs.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

## **The Last-Minute Life Saver**

### Background

Students, professionals, and entrepreneurs frequently miss deadlines, assignments, meetings, interviews, and important commitments. Most productivity applications rely only on passive reminders, which users often ignore.

### Challenge

Build an AI-powered productivity companion that proactively helps users plan, prioritize, and complete their work before deadlines are missed.

The solution should go beyond simple reminders and focus on helping users take meaningful action through intelligent planning.

### Our Solution

GoalMint AI combines Artificial Intelligence with practical productivity features by converting user goals into structured six-phase roadmaps and AI-generated tasks. Instead of simply notifying users, the platform helps them understand **what to do**, **when to do it**, and **how to achieve their goals** through personalized AI guidance.

# 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- AI-generated roadmaps are stored in the database.
- AI-generated tasks are stored after generation.
- API rate limiting reduces unnecessary requests.
- WhiteNoise efficiently serves static files.
- Docker ensures consistent deployment.
- Gunicorn provides a production-ready WSGI server.                             # 📈 Current Limitation

During development, we identified one important limitation in the current workflow.

At present, whenever a user creates a goal, GoalMint AI automatically generates a complete **6-phase roadmap** and AI-powered tasks.

This works well for long-term goals such as:

- Learning a new skill
- Placement preparation
- Building a startup
- Exam preparation

However, for simple activities such as:

- Attend a meeting at 5 PM
- Pay electricity bill
- Call a client
- Submit an assignment tomorrow

users only require a reminder instead of a complete roadmap.

This limitation has been identified and a future AI enhancement has already been designed.

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

The next version of GoalMint AI will introduce an **AI Intent Analyzer**.

Instead of directly generating a roadmap, the AI will first understand the user's intent and decide the most appropriate action.

| User Input | AI Decision | Output |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Attend Meeting at 5 PM | Reminder | Smart Reminder |
| Learn DSA | Long-Term Goal | AI Roadmap + Tasks |
| Crack Placements | Career Goal | AI Roadmap + Tasks |
| Exercise Daily | Habit | Habit Tracker |
| Build Portfolio | Project | AI Roadmap + Tasks |

---
